# HaloGen for Line Intensity Mapping

Modular halo model code for 3d power spectra of line intensity maps.
Computes the auto- and cross-spectra, as well as cross-correlations with galaxy tracers and lensing.

Requires pathos for multiprocessing (https://pypi.org/project/pathos/): 
```
pip install pathos
```
Just clone and run: 
```
python driver_lim.py
```
